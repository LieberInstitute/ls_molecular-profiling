# Project overview
This project includes snRNA-seq analysis of the human lateral septum (LS) from three separate donors. The two primary goals for this analysis are to 1) characterize transcriptional heterogeneity of the human LS, and 2) investigate cross-species conservation and divergence of marker genes.
